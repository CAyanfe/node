Step 1: Create a JavaScript File

In each task, create a JavaScript file in your working directory. Name it descriptively, such as "hello-world.js," "welcome.js," "welcome.txt," "generate-password.js," "email-sender.js," or a name that reflects the task's purpose.

Step 2: Install Dependencies

In tasks that require external packages, use the npm install command to install the necessary packages locally in your working directory. This avoids the need for a separate project folder.

Step 3: Write the Script

Write the JavaScript code in your file to accomplish the task. Include comments and detailed explanations of the code to make it clear and easy to understand. Step 4: Run the Script

Use the node command to run the JavaScript script from your command-line terminal. Ensure you are in the directory where the script is located. Important Notes for Sending Email (Task 5):

To send an email using the "nodemailer" package, you should provide your Gmail email address and password (or an app-specific password) in the script. You may need to enable "Less secure apps" or generate an app-specific password in your Gmail account settings to allow the script to send emails. By following these steps, you can complete the specified tasks and achieve the desired functionality without creating a separate project folder.
